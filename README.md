# langandcode
This repository is for all the codes and projects I have created or worked on either on my webapp https://languageandcodex.herokuapp.com/ or else.

# chatbot directory:
contains the source code of a tutorial I made on how to train a Chatterbot on your Massanger chat. Chatterbot is accessible through a terminal. 

I have implemented the Chatterbot into a Flask app and deployed it to https://flask-chatbotx.herokuapp.com/. Please check my other repository [https://github.com/MurphyAdam/Flask-chatbot](https://github.com/MurphyAdam/Flask-chatbot)

If you like to learn about the tutorial on how to train a Chatterbot on your Massanger chat, please refer to https://languageandcodex.herokuapp.com/articles/33/show. If you'd like to check out the tutorial on this app, please refer to https://languageandcodex.herokuapp.com/articles/34/show

Any contributions are always welcome.
